This project predicts if a patient is susceptible to getting a stroke, given a set of parameters (gender, age, hypertension, average glucose level, if the patient ever has heart disease, etc.), using different classification algorithms. The dataset used is publicly available in Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano. The dataset has been visualized to get initial insights and then it is pre-processed so that it can be fed into different classifiers. Classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine have been used.
